"""Attempt audio frame — thin HTTP adapter over internal orchestration.

Mirrors socket event: attempt_audio_frame.

Supports two modes:
  - upload_id: resolve an already-uploaded file and read its bytes
  - audio: base64-encoded raw PCM16 bytes (direct, like the socket)

Exactly one of upload_id or audio must be provided.
