"""Organization setup — seed definitions.

Dependency order (each module may reference IDs from earlier modules):
  1. departments
  2. personas       (refs: departments)
  3. fields         (refs: departments)
  4. parameters     (refs: fields, departments)
  5. settings       (refs: departments, auth, systems, thresholds)
  6. profiles       (updates: pre-existing profiles → department + email)

Updates are applied automatically after all creates:
  - departments.get_department_updates() → link departments to settings
  - profiles.profile_updates → link pre-existing profiles to department
